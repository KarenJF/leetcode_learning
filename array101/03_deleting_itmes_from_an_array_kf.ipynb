    "## Deleting From the End of an Array\n",
    "Deletion at the end of an Array is similar to people standing in a line, also known as a queue. The person who most recently joined the queue (at the end) can leave at any time without disturbing the rest of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting From the Start of an Array\n",
    "Next comes the costliest of all deletion operations for an Arrayâ€”deleting the first element. If we want to delete the first element of the Array, that will create a vacant spot at the 0th index. To fill that spot, we will shift the element at index 1 one step to the left. Going by the ripple effect, every element all the way to the last one will be shifted one place to the left. This shift of elements takes O(N) time, where N is the number of elements in the Array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting From Anywhere in the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "For deletion at any given index, the empty space created by the deleted item will need to be filled. Each of the elements to the right of the index we're deleting at will get shifted to the left by one. Deleting the first element of an Array is a special case of deletion at a given index, where the index is 0. This shift of elements takes O(K) time where K is the number of elements to the right of the given index. Since potentially K = N, we say that the time complexity of this operation is also O(N).\n"
